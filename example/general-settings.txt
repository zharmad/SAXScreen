# This is a file to share all variables across different BASH scripts.
# = = =
# It is read at the beginning through a bash function that evaluates $1=$2
# so sets the variable name as the 1st column with the contents in the second column
# Empty lines are skipped.
#
# Having this file here also serves as a convenient single location to
# check the definition between all files and their variables/meanings.
